## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For this project, I wanted to get a baseline on how long it takes to complete a project.  I spent about 30 minutes looking at the layout, figuring out how to organize the html, and writing out the html.  I spent about another hour and half coding out the CSS. I'm curious what's a normal completion time for this project would be.

I'm still not perfectly happy with how this one turned out, but I think it's close enough for a first pass.  

### Continued development

Areas I need to keep developing on:
1. Accessibilty and semantic HTML
2. Organization
